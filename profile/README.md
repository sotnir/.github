# Welcome to Southampton Neuroimaging Respository

This is the Github page for the _Southampton Neuroimaging Repository (SOTNIR)_.

SOTNIR is committed to facilitating neuroimaging research at Southampton by establishing an infrastructure for the storage, management, and seamless sharing of neuroimaging data, software, and protocols. This resource is designed to serve scientists and engineers at Southampton working in academic or clinical settings.

SOTNIR provides support for researchers to enhance project development for publication and funding applications, and support for students to access standardised workflows to carry out short-term projects and fulfill curriculum. 

SOTNIR advocates transparent and reproducible science, fostering positive interactions with external collaborators and the broader scientific community.
